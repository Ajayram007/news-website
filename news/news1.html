<p>A US judge has ruled Google acted illegally to crush its competition and maintain a monopoly on online search and related advertising.</p>
<p>The landmark decision on Monday is a major blow to Alphabet, Google's parent company, and could reshape how technology giants do business.</p>
<p>Google was sued by the US Department of Justice in 2020 over its control of about 90% of the online search market.
It is one of several lawsuits that have been filed against the big tech companies as US antitrust authorities attempt to strengthen competition in the industry.</p>
